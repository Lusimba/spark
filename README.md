# Spark Framework

A brand new JavaScript framework for modern web development. It's View based and supported with components. Spark Framework aims to be test driven and documented. 

It's heavily inspried from [Koding's KD Framework](https://github.com/koding/kd). However Spark Framework is built on top of Google's powerful Closure Library and awesome Closure Tools. 


### Future Plans
- Various components like TabPanel, GridPanel, Loader, Modal etc.
- Hassle free Router management.
- Supporting much better templating solution with Closure Templates and ReactJS.
- Custom build options for getting the minumum required parts of the framework for your own needs.
- Advanced compilation support for all framework.
- Create two versions of the framework which will be used in development and production. Allow production version to be used without Closure Library and Closure Tools which is the ultimate goal of this project. A framework with has a lot of features in it, but just 85Kb or less.


### Disclaimer
It's currently under development and not ready for using at production. Tests and/or advanced compilation may fail.
